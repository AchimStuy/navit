/** @file
 *
 * @brief Contains exported code for traffic.c, the traffic module
 *
 * This file contains types and function prototypes exported from the traffic module, which enables
 * Navit to route around traffic problems.
 *
 * The traffic module consists of two parts:
 *
 * The traffic core interacts with the Navit core and converts traffic messages into traffic
 * distortions (future versions may add support for other traffic information).
 *
 * The traffic backends obtain traffic information from a source of their choice (e.g. from a TMC
 * receiver or a network service), translate them into Navit data structures and report them to the
 * traffic plugin.
 *
 * Traffic messages and related structures are considered immutable once created (when information
 * changes, the old message is replaced with a new one). For this reason, there are very few data
 * manipulation methods. Those that exist are intended for the creation of new messages rather than
 * for extensive manipulation.
 *
 * As a rule, responsibility for freeing up any {@code traffic_*} instances normally lies with the
 * traffic plugin, which frees messages as they expire or are replaced. Since this also frees all child
 * data structures, traffic backends will seldom need to call any of the destructors. The only case in
 * which this would be necessary is if a backend has instantiated an object which is not going to be
 * used (i.e. attached to a parent object or, in the case of {@code traffic_message}, reported to the
 * traffic plugin: these need to be freed up manually by calling the destructor of the topmost object in
 * the hierarchy.
 *
 * Any other references passed in functions (including pointer arrays and {@code quantifier} instances)
 * must be freed up by the caller. This is safe to do as soon as the function returns.
